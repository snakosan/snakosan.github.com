<h4>If you want to make money, don't create a startup, create an 
industry. you will get trillions instead of millions.</h4>

<h4>difference between invention and innovation: </h4>
  - Not going incrementally but carving out new thing. 
  - If you think about the present, your ideas will be incremental 
  - "Learn the rules like a pro, to break them like an artist" -Picasso 

 	- not doing this is the silicon valleys biggest sin since the 80s, 
  - nobody bothered becoming a pro in software development or graphical interface


* XEROX PARC inventions:
  - personal computer, came 11 years before commercial Mac
  - GUI
  - WSYWIG (symmetrical reading and writing). not like the web which is made
    for consumption rather than authoring. 
  - Object oriented programming. (not like the current OOP)
  - laser printer 
  - Post script and fonts
  - Ethernet 
  - P2P and client server 

- only needed 25 researcher for 5 years 
- Cost about $10M-12M in todays money. 
- returns $35Trillion 
- Big companies refuse to have new businesses and ideas. otherwise
 startups wouldn't exist. 
- Real Xerox PARC ended in 1983 when Bob Taylor got fired and the
 entire team left with him. 
- We are born in a world not the same as the one that led to PARC. 
- Read "The dream machine- Licklider"
- read "the power of the context-by alan kay"
- whatever is going on these days is crap. 
- US was on WW2 for 3.5 years only but lots of things got done. 
    - Manhatten project, Radar project, SAGE air defence
- Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad. WOW shocking . Done it in one year 
  for PhD thesis. read it.

<h4>Licklider: </h4>
- pick and idea to dedicate your whole life to. Really advance
      something really important
- forget about goals. Only Visions. 
- fund people not projects 
- only fund the very best people. (McArthur for groups)
- its a research community not a project.
- fund problem finding not solving.
- milestones not deadlines.
- baseball not golf , 5 yr commitment.
- if you can make your tools , HW and SW then do 
- software drives hardware rather than vice versa. 
- make enough of inventions so that more than inventors can use them. 
- Argue for clarity , not to win. 


<h4>Wayne Gretzky: </h4>
"a good hockey player goes to where the puck is, 
  a great one goes to where it will be"
1- Develop a good cosmic intuition.
2- Identify favourable exponential. 
3- Take the intuition out 30 years ahead.
4- Can we say "it would be rediculous if we didn't have this"?
5- Bring it back to the 10-15 yrs point. can something be done?
6- Make a bunch of flexible supercomputers and adapt to design learning.
7- Invent software for the future.


<h4>importance of Context</h4>
- Imagine you have twice Leonardo Davinci's IQ, would be easy to go to stanford. 
- but if you born into 1000 BC, how far you gonna get? 
- Henry Ford was no where near his IQ, created a process for millions of cars
- Leonardo couldn't invent any motor for his vehicle 
- Ford born on the right century. 
- context will give you 80 IQ points 
- knowledge is silver, context is gold, IQ is just lead. 

* Better and perfect are the enemy of what is actually needed. 

- Wayne Gretzky game, go where the puck is going. Design and build for the future and 
being results back to the present.
- This is where the trillions rather than the billions come in. 
- you are in life moving in a plane (say pink), but suddenly, during a shower
 or so, you discover another plane, a blue one, vertical to the pink one. 
 and you say, oh my god... and may be there are other planes out there. 

<h4>Human Universals</h4>
Anthropoligists studies thousands of cultures and outlines properties
 of them that are never absent: 
- Genetics hold the desires, and culture fills in the parameters 
- Hunting /Gathering
- Coping: we are good with coping, e.g. with hardship 
- Oral languages 
- Stories, superstition, religion, magic
- News 
- fast thinking, quick reaction to patterns, case based learning 
- differences over similarities (thats why prog. languages went wrong)
- vendetta /revenge (best games are vendetta based)
- fun , games
	- 
<h4>Human non-universals</h4>
- Agriculture. 
- progress: its an 18th century invention. in all times people lived and 
  died in the same setting. 
- writing and reading 
- science, deductive reasoning, math
- new
- slow deep thinking
- similarities over differences 
- legal system 
	

-  MacOS, linux and windows systems, but non of them is doing what anglebert
 was demonstrating. multiple people sharing and collaborating on an entity
 smoothly, doable but on an operating systems level. 
-  Web is bullshit. where is WISYWIG ? you need to press a button to see how
 it looks? but no one is protesting. 
- find ways to critisize what looks normal. 
	
<h3> Make an amplifier to the human universal list and you will be a billionare </h3>
