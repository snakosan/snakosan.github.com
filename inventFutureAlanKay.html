<br>

<h5>If you want to make money, don't create a startup, create an 
industry. you will get trillions instead of millions.</h5>
<br>
<h6>Difference between invention and innovation: </h6>
<ul>
  <li>Not going incrementally but carving out new thing.</li>
  <li>If you think about the present, your ideas will be incremental </li>
  <li>"Learn the rules like a pro, to break them like an artist" -Picasso</li>
  <li>Not doing this is the silicon valleys biggest sin since the 80s,</li>
  <li>Nobody bothered becoming a pro in software development or graphical interface</li>
</ul>

<h6>XEROX PARC inventions: </h6>

<ul>
  <li>personal computer, came 11 years before commercial Mac.</li>
  <li>GUI </li>
  <li>WSYWIG (symmetrical reading and writing). not like the web which is made
    for consumption rather than authoring.</li>
  <li>Object oriented programming. (not like the current OOP)</li>
  <li>laser printer </li>
  <li>Post script and fonts</li>
  <li>Ethernet</li>
  <li>P2P and client server </li>
  <li>only needed 25 researcher for 5 years </li>
  <li>Cost about $10M-12M in todays money. </li>
  <li>returns $35Trillion </li>
  <li>Big companies refuse to have new businesses and ideas. otherwise
    startups wouldn't exist. </li>
    <li>Real Xerox PARC ended in 1983 when Bob Taylor got fired and the
      entire team left with him. </li>
      <li>We are born in a world not the same as the one that led to PARC. </li>
      <li>Read "The dream machine- Licklider"</li>
<li>read "the power of the context-by alan kay"</li>
<li>whatever is going on these days is crap. </li>
<li>US was on WW2 for 3.5 years only but lots of things got done. </li>
<li>Manhatten project, Radar project, SAGE air defence</li>
<li>Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad. WOW shocking . Done it in one year 
  for PhD thesis. read it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Licklider: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>pick and idea to dedicate your whole life to. Really advance
    something really important</li>
<li>forget about goals. Only Visions. </li> 
<li>fund people not projects </li>
<li>only fund the very best people. (McArthur for groups)</li>
<li>its a research community not a project.</li>
<li>fund problem finding not solving.</li>
<li>milestones not deadlines.</li>
<li>baseball not golf , 5 yr commitment.</li>
<li>if you can make your tools , HW and SW then do</li>
<li>software drives hardware rather than vice versa. </li>
<li>make enough of inventions so that more than inventors can use them.</li>
<li>Argue for clarity , not to win. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Wayne Gretzky: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>a good hockey player goes to where the puck is, 
    a great one goes to where it will be"</li>
    <li>Develop a good cosmic intuition.</li>
    <li>Identify favourable exponential. </li>
    <li>Take the intuition out 30 years ahead.</li>
<li>Can we say "it would be rediculous if we didn't have this"?</li>
<li>Bring it back to the 10-15 yrs point. can something be done?</li>
<li>Make a bunch of flexible supercomputers and adapt to design learning.</li>
<li>Invent software for the future</li>
</ul>

<h4>importance of Context</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Imagine you have twice Leonardo Davinci's IQ, would be easy to go to stanford.</li>
<li>but if you born into 1000 BC, how far you gonna get? </li>
<li>Henry Ford was no where near his IQ, created a process for millions of cars</li>
<li>Leonardo couldn't invent any motor for his vehicle </li>
<li>Ford born on the right century. </li>
<li>context will give you 80 IQ points</li>
<li>knowledge is silver, context is gold, IQ is just lead. </li>
<li>Better and perfect are the enemy of what is actually needed</li>


<li>Wayne Gretzky game, go where the puck is going. Design and build for the future and 
  being results back to the present.</li>
<li>This is where the trillions rather than the billions come in. 
  you are in life moving in a plane (say pink), but suddenly, during a shower
   or so, you discover another plane, a blue one, vertical to the pink one. 
   and you say, oh my god... and may be there are other planes out there. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Human Universals</h4>
Anthropoligists studies thousands of cultures and outlines properties
 of them that are never absent: 
 <ul>
  <li>Genetics hold the desires, and culture fills in the parameters </li>
  <li>Hunting /Gathering</li>
  <li>Coping: we are good with coping, e.g. with hardship </li>
<li>Oral languages </li>
<li>Stories, superstition, religion, magic</li>
<li>News </li>
<li>fast thinking, quick reaction to patterns, case based learning </li>
<li>differences over similarities (thats why prog. languages went wrong)</li>
<li>vendetta /revenge (best games are vendetta based)</li>
<li>fun , games</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Human non-universals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Agriculture. </li>
  <li>progress: its an 18th century invention. in all times people lived and 
    died in the same setting. </li>
<li>writing and reading </li>
<li>science, deductive reasoning, math</li>
<li>slow deep thinking</li>
<li>similarities over differences </li>
<li>legal system </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>MacOS, linux and windows systems, but non of them is doing what anglebert
    was demonstrating. multiple people sharing and collaborating on an entity
    smoothly, doable but on an operating systems level. </li>
    <li>
      Web is bullshit. where is WISYWIG ? you need to press a button to see how
      it looks? but no one is protesting. 
    </li>
    <li>
      find ways to critisize what looks normal.
    </li>
</ul>
  <h4> Make an amplifier to the human universal list and you will be a billionare </h4>
