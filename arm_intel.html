          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Arm and Intel, less is more?</h2>
<br>
          <p>The main purpose of the CPU is to do logical and arithmetic calculations.
            Have a bunch of them and you have a program. These calculations are done by sending one instruction at a
            time.
            Move this number here, add this number to the number in that place, and put the outcome there, are examples.
          </p>
          <p>The instruction set is the set of all supported instructions by the
            CPU. But, how detailed this instruction should be? SIMPLE as in just
            add a to b, or COMPLEX as in multiply a by b.</p>
          <p>The multiplication can be done as a single or many instructions. Single
            instruction needs a complex hardware that performs all the steps. This
            distinction between a clean, and minimal instruction set (i.e. interface)
            and a complex, wealthy set is not as superficial as it seems.</p>

          <p>The simple approach is Called RISC for reduced instruction set computer,
            while the Complex instruction set computer is CISC.</p>
          <p>The distinction is about who does the heavy lifting, the programmer or
            the hardware. With RISC simplicity, the complexity of the program is
            compensated for by the programmer. For CISC, it is harder for the hardware
            developer but easy for the programmer. Here are more distinctions:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>
              Simple RISC provides single clock instructions only. Complex CISC have
              multiple-clock complex instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple RISC can only move data between registers. Complex CISC is more
              able. It can move data even between memory locations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple RISC leads to larger code size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple RISC can use more extra transistors for memory registers.
              Complex CISC needs more for complex instructions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Think about the simplicity of the Swiss knife vs the complexity of a large
            tool box.
          </p>

          <p>
            But which approach is better? The simple or the complex. This is a deep
            life question. But let's focus on microprocessors.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the moment, two big players are on the field. The first is the American
            Intel, with its complex CISC. The other is the British ARM, with its simple
            RISC. Intel wanted to be the Ferrari, getting the best performance out of
            the CPU. ARM wanted to save on fuel, they RISC'ed it for high energy efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Indeed, ARM's lower energy consumption is what made it occupy the smartphone
            market. Smartphones operate on batteries. Their TDP (Thermal design power)
            requirement is only 3.5W. Intel's core I7 has a 100W TDP. This is good when
            high performance is needed such as in Servers and high performance desktops.
          </p>

          <p>
            can ARM scale up its performance when needed? Can Intel scale down its
            performance to consume very low power?
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this question is not separate from other important factors. Intel
            business model is different from ARMs. While ARM only focuses on the design
            of CPU cores and licensing them to their clients (such as Qualcomm and Apple).
            Intel does everything in-house. Intel wins with the vertical integration and
            ecosystem but ARM win by having their clients having access to the innovative
            fabrication facilities such as TSMC in Taiwan. TSMC at the moment have a 5nm
            process node while Intel is stuck at 14nm from 2014.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the moment of writing, things are still unclear. ARM is venturing
            into the laptop and desktop market. Apple's M1 which is a custom IP
            license is used in the latest Apple Mac book pro and air. Its performance
            is ahead of its predecessors using Intel's.
            Nvidia has bought ARM from SoftBank, and Nvidia is aiming big at the data
            centres business. Intel isn't going to sit there and watch, they definitely
            have something up their sleeve.
