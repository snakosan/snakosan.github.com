<br> 
from   <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Eric S Reymond's blog </a>

<p>Has technical knowledge, and enjoys problem solving and overcoming limits.</p>

<p>history: at the time of time sharing minicomputers, and ARPAnet experiments.</p>
<ul>

  <li>The term hacker originated from there.</li>
  <li>Hackers built the Internet.</li>
  <li>They made Unix.</li>
  <li>They made  the World Wide Web.</li>
</ul>
         
         
         
         
<p>If you are part of this culture, and contributed to it, and other people in
  it call you a hacker,
      then you are a hacker.</p>

<p>Hacker mindset is not confined to software only. it's independent of the
  medium. Hackers respect all hackers types.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hackers are NOT those who break into computers. These are called crackers.
  </li>
  <li>Real hackers think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright. </li>
  <li>Being able to hotwire cars doesn't make you an automotive engineer. </li>
  <li>Hackers build things, crackers break them. </li>
</ul>

<h5> Hackers attitude:</h5>
<p>
<ul>

  <li>Hackers solve problems, and build things.</li>
  <li>Hackers believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.</li>
  <li>Most effective way to become a master is to imitate the mind-set of
    masters, intellectually and emotionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>To Follow the path:</p>
<ul>
<li> look to the master,</li>
<li> follow the master,</li>
<li> walk with the master,</li>
<li> see through the master,</li>
<li> become the master</li>
-- Zen poem
</ul>

  
  
</p>

<h5>Repeat the following until you believe them</h5>

<ol type="1">
<li> The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</li>

<p> To be a hacker, you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems,
  sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.</p>
<p> If you are not like this naturally, you will be distracted by things
like sex, money and social approval. </p>

<p> Develop a faith in your learning ability, even though you know only one
  piece, you can learn to tackle the next piece.</p>
<li>No problem should ever have to be solved twice :
  <p>    - Thinking time of hackers is precious.
    - Moral duty for you to share information. solve problems, and give
    solution away for other hackers.
    - That doesn't mean take existing solutions as sacred.
    - you are not obligated to give all your creative products away,
    but those who do earn hackers respect.
    - you can sell enough to feed your family, as long as you don't forget
    your loyalty to your fellow hackers.</p>
</li>


<li>
  Boredom and drudgery are evil:
</li>
<p>    - hackers and creative people should never be bored, or
  do stupid repetitive work.
  - you should want to automate the boring bits as much as possible.
  , not just for yourself, but also for everyone else.</p>
<li>
  Freedom is good:
</li>
- Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian.
- Authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it.
- But this is not the same as fighting all authority, children need
to be guided.
- Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. They distrust
  voluntary cooperation and information sharing. they only like
  cooperation that they control.
<li>
  Attitude is no subtitute for competence:
</li>
- Becoming a hacker will take intelligence, practice, dedication,
and hardwork.
- If you value competence, you will enjoy developing it in yourself.
Hard work and dedication will become intense play rather than drudgery.

* Basic Hacking Skills:
======================

1- learn how to program:
    - start with python if you don't know any.
    - I used to suggest Java as a first language, but changed my mind,
    a hacker cannot approach problem-solving like a plumber in a hardware
    store, you have to know what the components actually do. better to learn
     C or Lisp first.
    - if you get serious, you have to learn C, the core of Unix.
    - like learning to write good natural language, best way is to read some
     stuff written by masters, write some things yourself, read a lot more,
      write a little more,....

2- Get one of the open-source unixes and learn to use and run it:
    - hackers culture is heavily unix centered, its open source, powers most
    of servers and the Internet.

3- Learn how to use the web and write html.
4- If you don't have functional english, learn it.


* Getting status in hacker culture:
====================================

5 ways to be respected by hackers:
    1- write open source software
        others find useful or fun.
        hackers most revered icons are people who have written large
        capable programs that met widespread need and given them away.

    2- help test and debug open source software:
        good beta-testers are worth their weight in rubies.
    3- publish useful information:
        collect and filter useful and interesting information into webpages,
        and docs like FAQs.
        make them generally available.

    4- Help keep the infrastructure working:
        hacker culture is run by volunteers.
        lots of unglamorous work need to be done to keep going, administring
         emails, newsgroups, archiving, ...etc

    5- serve the hacker culture itself:
        hacking culture doesn't have leaders. but it has heroes, and tribal
        elders.
        when you have been in the trenches long enough, you may grow into
        one of these.
        Hackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders. Dont reach for
        that kind of fame. Be modest and gracious about your status.

* Points for style
==================
things you can do when you are not at your computer.
    1- Learn to write your native language well. even though its common
    stereotype that programmers can't write.
    2- Read science fiction.
    3- Join a hackspace.
    4- Train in martial arts form: it fosters mental discipline,
        most popular form are Asian empty hand arts, Karate, Kungfu,TaeKwonDo,
        most hackerly martial arts are those that emphasize mental
        discipline, relaxed awareness, and precise control. rather than raw
        strength, athleticism, or physical toughness.

    5- Study an actual meditaion discipline. favourite is Zen.
    6- Develop Analytical ear for music. learn to play some muisical instrument well.
    7- Develop appreciation for puns and word play.

No boundary between work and play.
Hackers don't do things by halves, if they invest in a skill, they tend to
be very good at it.

things not to do:
    1- dont use silly, grandiose user ID or screen name. hackers are proud
     of what they do and want it associated with their real names.
    2- don't gent in flame wars on Usenet.
    3- Don't call yourself cyberpunk, or waste your time on anybody who does.
    4- Don't post or email writing full of spelling errors and bad grammer.
